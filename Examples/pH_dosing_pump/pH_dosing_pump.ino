/*This code was written for the Instructable "DIY PH DOSING PUMP" (Link:https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-PH-DOSING-PUMP/) 
  and hackster.io "DIY pH Dosing Pump" (Link: https://www.hackster.io/atlas-scientific/diy-ph-dosing-pump-061cef)
  It was tested on an Arduino UNO.
  Real time pH monitoring is done using the EZO pH sensor and two EZO PMP. The pumps dispense pH UP and pH DOWN solutions into the sample and they are triggered in accordance with the current pH reading.
  The goal is to maintain the pH level of the sample between 8 and 8.5
  The sensors must be calibrated and switched to I2C mode before using this code. The ability to send commands to the sensors is not incorporated here.
  After uploading the code to your arduino, open the serial monitor, set the baud rate to 9600 and select "Carriage return". The pH dosing system is now active.*/
