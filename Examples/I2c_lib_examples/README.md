**EC_parsing_and_DO_compensation:** demonstrates how to receive an EC reading with multiple parameters and use them to compensate the DO circuit's readings

**I2c_read_mulitple_circuits:** a basic example of how to use the sequencer library to read data from two circuits

**humidity_parsing:** demonstrates how to receive a humidity reading with multiple parameters and destructure the parameters into seperate numbers

**i2c_scan_and_comms_example:** scans the I2C line for an ezo device (lowest address thats on the line) and lets you send commands to it using the serial terminal. Use the "ADDR" command to change that devices' address. 

**iot_cmd_sample_code:** large example that demonstrates polling 3 devices for readings and also lets you send commands to any of them from the serial terminal. Use the "HELP" command for more details

**temp_comp_example:** demonstrates how to temperature compensate an EC circuits' readings using an RTD circuit

**temp_comp_rt_example:** demonstrates how to temperature compensate an EC circuits' readings using an RTD circuit with the "RT" command
